Nexora – Stay Aligned. Stay Unstoppable.

AISSMS TENET Hackathon 2025 Submission

🚩 Problem Statement

In today’s hyper-digital world, distractions hijack focus—impacting careers, studies, finances, and health.
Social media scrolling, gaming, overspending, and binge content drain consistency.

Existing solutions? Rigid blockers that treat symptoms, not causes.
The result: an epidemic of lost potential, declining focus, and regret—a silent productivity crisis.

💡 Our Solution: Nexora

Nexora is a prototype designed to redefine digital focus by merging task management, distraction control, and AI-powered mentorship into a single ecosystem.

Its unique selling point:
👉 A blend of goal management + distraction monitoring + real-time collaboration, powered by intelligent AI interventions.

We built an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that showcases the full workflow—from onboarding to real-time productivity tracking and intelligent feedback.

🎯 Key Features
🏗 Core Workflow

Secure Onboarding – Email + Operator ID verification with confirmation.

Operator Dashboard – Personalized overview of aligned vs distracted minutes, deviation alerts, and dynamic work status (Nominal / Critical).

Objectives Page – Create unlimited objectives, set deadlines, budgets, and define blocked/allowed domains.

📊 Tracking & Analysis

Clearance System – Performance measured dynamically; e.g., completion < 50% = Critical, ≥ 5 clearance = Nominal.

Timeline Page – Visualizes all focus vs distraction activities.

👥 Collaboration

Mentor–Mentee–Peer connections based on semantic embeddings & progress levels.

Real-time chat with advanced search for expanding networks.

🔎 AI Interventions

Activity Monitor – Detects phone usage & inactivity, triggers alerts.

Supervisor Dashboard – AI-generated adaptive feedback (Ollama LLM).

Matrix-style Rewind – Simulates “what could have happened” if focus was maintained.

🛡 Distraction Control

Chrome Extension – Monitors browsing, enforces:

Soft Blocks → Timeout with resume.

Hard Blocks → Instant redirection to supervisor advice.

🎭 Personalization

Identity Configuration – Avatars, goal-linked persona.

Settings Page – Dark/light mode, notification control, overlay permissions, domain blocking preferences, and activity monitoring.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend

React + JavaScript (UI)

HTML, CSS

Chrome Extension for site monitoring & blocking

Backend

Node.js + Express.js (API & server logic)

Database

PostgreSQL (Supabase Auth + Storage)

Supabase Realtime (live chat & collaboration)

AI / ML

Ollama (lightweight LLM for mentor feedback & nudges)

Hugging Face Semantic Embeddings (goal alignment & peer matching)

Mediapipe (face-attention & distraction detection)

Unity (AR mentor overlays)

🔬 Technical Feasibility

Browser Control – Chrome Extension APIs handle blocking & redirection in real time.

AI Integration – Lightweight LLMs + embeddings make semantic feedback deployable.

Collaboration – Supabase Realtime ensures instant peer connections & live chat.

⚠️ Limitations

User Compliance – Motivated users may bypass via incognito/alternate browsers.

Behavioral Resistance – Nudges can be ignored or disabled.

AR Avatars – Currently limited set, no lip-sync during advice.

🚀 Future Scope

Scalability – Edge functions, caching, advanced LLM integration.

AI Features – Multimodal (voice, text, vision), emotion-aware feedback.

Cross-Platform Expansion – Mobile apps, AR/VR modules.

Adoption – LMS & corporate productivity integrations.

AI Context Understanding – Smarter activity classification from browsing & apps.
